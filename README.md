# Blind side

## What this is built with

The whole product: an API and the screens that use it.

- **Django** with **Django REST Framework** for the API.
- **SimpleJWT** for authentication, against a custom user model in `apps/users`.
- **drf-spectacular** for the OpenAPI schema, served at `/api/schema/` and browsable at `/api/docs/`.
- **React** with **Vite** for the dev server and the build.
- **Chakra UI** for components, and **React Router** for routes.
- **TanStack Query** for every call to the API, so caching and refetching are decided in one place.

## Setting it up

You need the CLI once: `npm install -g blacksmith-cli`.

```bash
blacksmith setup     # dependencies, database, migrations
blacksmith dev       # start it
```

The API answers on `http://localhost:8000`, and the app on `http://localhost:5173`.

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` before the first run. It is ignored by git and holds the secret key, the database URL and anything else this project should not carry in its history.

## Day to day

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `blacksmith dev` | Run it locally. |
| `blacksmith sync` | Regenerate the frontend API types and hooks from the backend schema. Run it after changing a serializer or a route. |
| `blacksmith make:resource Post` | Scaffold a model, serializer, viewset and routes, plus the hooks and pages that use them. |
| `blacksmith backend <command>` | Run a Django management command, e.g. `blacksmith backend createsuperuser`. |
| `blacksmith frontend <command>` | Run an npm command in the frontend, e.g. `blacksmith frontend install axios`. |
| `blacksmith eject` | Remove Blacksmith and keep a plain Django and React project. Nothing here is a dependency on us. |
